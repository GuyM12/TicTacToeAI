# TicTacToeAI
TicTacToe written in java. using AI module
The program is not fully AI and I wrote it in five minutes so the code is not the most optimized it can be. also there is being used lots of "ifs" because is was quicker to write for the single purpose. (Tic Tac Toe is solved, i.e there are simple steps to either win or make a draw deppends on the second player's moves)
